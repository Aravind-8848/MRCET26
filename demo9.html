        <p>Bhagat Singh was a fearless revolutionary and a prominent figure in India’s struggle for independence from British rule.
        Born on September 28, 1907, in a patriotic Sikh family in Punjab, he was deeply influenced by the freedom movement from an early age.
        As he grew older, Bhagat Singh became disillusioned with the non-violent approach of some freedom fighters and joined the Hindustan
        Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), believing that armed resistance was necessary to fight British oppression. He came into the 
        national spotlight after he and his comrades killed a British officer, J.P. Saunders, to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, who had 
        died after a police lathi charge. Later, in 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw non-lethal bombs in the Central Legislative 
        Assembly to protest against repressive laws, shouting slogans like “Inquilab Zindabad” before surrendering. His arrest, trial, and 
        powerful writings during imprisonment inspired millions. Despite massive public support, Bhagat Singh was executed on March 23, 1931, at 
        the young age of 23, along with his companions Rajguru and Sukhdev. He is remembered as a martyr and a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and 
        revolutionary spirit in India’s fight for freedom.</p>
